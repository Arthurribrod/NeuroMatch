## üìå Summary

This study investigates how spiking activity from different brain regions in the mouse cortex and hippocampus predicts behavioral choices in a visual discrimination task. Using data from Steinmetz et al. (2019), we:
- Analyzed spike data from CA3, DG, ACA, MOp, and MOs
- Applied logistic regression and SVM classifiers to decode choice and correctness
- Examined how signal timing and accuracy evolve with task difficulty
- Visualized hierarchical flow of decision-related activity
- Distinguished excitatory vs inhibitory contributions via waveform duration

## üß™ Key Methods
- Logistic regression & SVM classification (time-resolved)
- Dimensionality reduction (UMAP, PCA)
- Cross-temporal generalization analysis
- PSTH generation and latency analysis
- Graph-based metrics (modularity, small-worldness)
- Cell-type classification (based on waveform peak-to-trough)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools
- Python 3.11, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- Data: Steinmetz et al. (2019) Neuropixels dataset
- Analysis hardware: AMD Ryzen 9 7600, 32GB DDR5 RAM

## üí° Future Directions
- Integrate optogenetic silencing to verify circuit causality
- Extend classification models to thalamus and basal ganglia
- Test generalization to non-visual tasks and species
- Implement closed-loop BCI using real-time neural predictors

## üìÅ Repository Contents
- `Neuromatch_TinyRodents_ArthurRodrigues.zip`: Contains all analysis code and plots
- `README.md`: Project summary
- [Link to Zenodo / DOI will be added once published]
